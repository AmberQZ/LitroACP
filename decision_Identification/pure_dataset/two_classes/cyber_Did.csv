40,The reviewer can be added to the list of reviewers for that paper.,1
41,The pages of the reviewers are generated once by the maintainer when the paper distribution has been done.,1
42,"Based on the preferences and the reviewers' expertise, CyberChair calculates a paper assignment proposal for the chair, where as many as possible preferences of the reviewers are honored, provided that all papers are assigned to an equal number of reviewers (so also the papers that did not get any preferences), and all reviewers are assigned as much as possible an equal number of papers.",1

50,The reviewers’ reviews are compared to the other reviews to detect conflicts.,1
51,"This list is sorted, based on the number of papers the reviewers have already been assigned so far.",1
52,"Moreover, since we chose to regenerate the state of all papers displayed on the reviewer’s webpage every 5 minutes, this would make it almost impossible for reviewers to enter a review form.",1

145,Below is a description of the latest version of CyberChair.,0
146,We showed that browsers of today are able to send requests without the user taking action.,0
147,The authors claim that there is no provision for a server to send asynchronous updates.,0
148,Sites like Amazon  use this style and regenerate a complete new page after every mouse click.,0

150,The maintainer also makes sure that overviews are generated at regular intervals.,0
151,"Using the WWW, a commonality these days, the ones involved in the process can collaboratively use CyberChair to store possibly and possibly retrieve data from password-protected areas controlled by CyberChair.",0
152,"When the reviewer clicks on a paper number, this causes the activation of a CGI script that in its turn generates a frameset, consisting of 3 frames (See figure 4).",0
153,"The CGI scripts have been written in Python, a very powerful, easy-to-learn programming language, which allows rapid implementation.",0
154,CyberChair is written in the Python programming language.,0
155,"Nowadays it is common practise to use electronic submissions for conferences, workshops and journals.",0
156,Other conferences and workshops that use(d) CyberChair can be found on an overview.,0
157,"Using frames allows for updates on specific parts of the screen, so that only data that has changed can be updated without the need to refresh the complete screen.",0
158,"The next years the system was improved and more features, such as uploading of papers, were included in the system to support the process.",0
159,"You may try a demonstration version of CyberChair, by acting as:",0
160,"Although, compared to sending hardcopies by surface mail, this is a big step forward, it may still be quite cumbersome to maintain the administration.",0
161,"BSCW could therefore be used to store abstracts, papers and reviews.",0
162,"As mentioned before, a reviewer’s page consists of several frames (a frame set).",0
163,"The following administrative tasks can be identified during a typical review process: Author information, abstract and paper submission, paper-to-reviewer assignment, paper distribution, filling in and sending review forms, collecting review forms and ordering them, preparing the PC meeting, returning the reviewers’ comments to the authors, camera-ready paper submission and preparation of proceedings.",0
164,"It is known to run on versions 1.5.2, 2.0.1 and 2.1.3, be it that the latter may cause deprication warnings (2.1 does not, while 2.2.1 does for sure).",0
165,"This includes editing the files that contain the templates for the PCC and reviewer information, the file containing the main topics of the conference, and setting up a website.",0
166,"The conflict detection and coloring scheme used to indicate the state of reviews has, as far as we know, not been used in other systems that handle review processes.",0
167,"In this paper we describe CyberChair, a web-based group­ware application that supports the review process for technical contributions to conferences.",0
168,Here is an overview of the activities CyberChair supports or carries out.,0
169,"As of this writing, CyberChair has been used successfully for 10 conferences or workshops, while currently half a dozen other conferences are planning to use it.",0
170,The tasks mentioned above have been automated by CyberChair.,0
171,"Depending on how busy our webserver is, the copying may not be completed before you click on a link.",0
172,Please put or leave the 'Would you like to receive a copy of your review per e-mail?',0
173,"More conference management systems exist , although we could not find publications about them in the litterature.",0
174,"The problematic use of groupware applications, as reported in several publications  is not affecting CyberChair.",0
175,The reviewers' pages are regenerated frequently in order to reflect changes (such as conflicting reviews).,0
176,"In short, CyberChair fully supports all activities that come with the review process: the abstract and (camera-ready) paper submission, the reviewer assignment (based on the reviewers' preferences and expertise), the review submission process, the notifications of acceptance and rejection, the preparation of the proceedings (according to the Springer-Verlag procedure), and the abstracts for the conference website and program booklet.",0
177,Identifying the right reviewers for papers is a difficult task.,0
178,"Up until its 1996 edition, the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP) used hard-copy review forms.",0
179,"When email is used for the submission of papers and reviews, the physical distribution of papers, which is still used for many conferences, is no longer needed.",0
180,The size of this pool is influenced by the maximum number of papers that is assigned to reviewers based on their preferences.,0
181,This problem is handled by CyberChair by the conflict detection mechanism and availability of other reviewers’ reviews.,0
182,"When done by hand, the paper assignment usually is a very time consuming job.",0
183,"The top frame is automatically updated every 5 minutes, to reflect the current state of the reviews of the papers.",0
184,Figure 7 shows a part of a paper distribution as generated by CyberChair.,0
185,"The original poster is in B1 format, so you may need to zoom in to read all details.",0
186,"For each conference or workshop the tuning should be considered carefully, since it heavily depends on the number of submissions, the number of reviewers, their expertise and the number of papers per reviewer.",0
187,This information is used for the paper distribution.,0
188,"Jean-Guy Schneider, Markus Lumpe and Oscar Nierstrasz describe CyberChair in Agent Coordination via Scripting Languages, Chapter 6 of the book Coordination of Internet Agents: Models, Technologies and Applications, Andrea Omic, Fanco Zambonelli, Matthias Klusch and Robert Tolksdorf (Eds.)",0
189,Especially that part of the browser window must be left as is while the reviewer is filling in the review form.,0
190,We are aware that the pages could also have been created by using tables.,0
191,Members of the PC are also called ’reviewers’,0
192,"March 2000, CyberChair was regularly updated to include new ideas, and suggestions by its users.",0
193,CyberChair takes care of the rest.,0
194,"The colored boxes indicate the state of the reviews, which is determined each time a review is submitted by any of the reviewers.",0
195,Chair -  Use chair or chair as login & password combination.,0
196,The pattern Identify the Conflicts  is used to determine the state of the reviews.,0
197,This section explains how the CyberChair handles the administration and supports its users during the complete reviewing process.,0
198,"CyberChair's functionality is described in detail in a paper, which is titled CyberChair: A Web-Based Groupware Application to Facilitate the Paper Reviewing Process.",0
199,The script is currently optimally tuned for ECOOP 2000.,0
200,"All you have to do is prepare the PC meeting, write acceptance and rejection messages, and the preface of the proceedings.",0
201,"This is done by showing the options for the kinds of users of CyberChair: the maintainer, the authors, the PCC and the reviewers.",0
202,Just retry a few seconds later if this happens.,0
203,Each of these frames is filled by using the name of a CGI script in the SRC tag of the frame definition.,0
204,"We hope, by describing CyberChair, to have answered",0
205,This page consists of several dynamically generated HTML frames.,0
206,A commonality between BSCW  and CyberChair is that both provide a shared workspace.,0
207,"This is quite inefficient, because much of the data that did not change is also regenerated.",0
208,A commonality between CyberChair and gIBIS  is that both systems provide means to make high-quality decisions by providing the group members’ arguments to each other.,0
209,"Further, overviews are available that contain, per conference topic, all abstracts, and an overview that contains all abstracts.",0
210,"If you'd like to use CyberChair, but would rather not be bugged by installing and customizing CyberChair yourself (and use the latest, greatest version of CyberChairPRO, which is easier to work with, which has more tools, and streamlined versions of existing tools), you might want to consider delegating the submission and review process organization to a spin-off company specialized in managing this process, set up by the author of CyberChair: Borbala Online Conference Services.",0
211,It is not clear to us if BSCW could also be used to create a dynamic review system.,0
212,Like Java it runs on a virtual machine and is available for many platforms.,0
213,"Furthermore, there is support for the preparation of the proceedings.",0
214,Graph theory (nodes with labeled edges) is used to solve this assignment problem.,0
215,"It eases the submission of author information, papers and reviews instantly in electronic form, using the web.",0
216,"Although more conference management systems exist  and many conferences use electronic uploading and some kind of reviewing system, no such system was found in the literature.",0
217,"After that, only bugfixes were made.",0
218,"It was first developed for ECOOP'97, and has been extended since, based on new ideas and the suggestions and remarks of its users (the chairs, the reviewers and submitters).",0
219,"Currently the script is tuned to assign as much as possible papers to reviewers based on their preferences, provided that all papers are assigned to exactly 4 reviewers and all reviewers are assigned approximately the same number of papers.",0
220,"The top frame, containing the paper numbers in colored boxes, is updated every 5 minutes by using a so-called meta tag containing the ’refresh’ option.",0
221,A very important issue for the conference organization is that using CyberChair will save them a lot of money on copying papers and mailing the papers to the reviewers (which might open up room to delegate the management of the submission and review process - see below).,0
222,The version described in this paper was used for ECOOP 2000 and  the International Workshop on Software Specification and  Design (IWSSD-10).,0
223,The resulting TeX file is according to Springer's editor's instructions.,0
224,"If you'd like to use CyberChair, which is free software (GNU General Public License), please fill in a customization form.",0
225,"Further, links are provided that contain all reviews of the reviewer, and all reviews of all reviewers of the paper, respectively.",0
